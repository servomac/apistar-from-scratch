# API Star from scratch

[API Star](https://github.com/tomchristie/apistar) is a web framework at early stages, centered in API construction. Its development is leaded by Tom Christie, the developer of [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

See [this slides](http://www.encode.io/talks/rethinking-the-web-api-framework/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#0) from his talk in the DjangoCon Europe. There is also a [community forum]() of the framework.

This is a step by step tutorial to develop a simple API using this framework, heavily inspired by [JavaScript Stack from Scratch](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch).

> This project is a work in process, that could be parallel to the development and new versions of API Star. Please, feel free to open an issue and/or fork this project to contribute. Hopefully this could be used as an open and live discussion about API development good practices.
